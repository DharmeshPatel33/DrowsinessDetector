# DrowsinessDetector
The application aims to create a system which shall detect when a driver is drowsy, and shall play an alarm in order to wake him/her up. To achieve our goal we are going to train a small Convolutional neural network (CNN) with Keras and then using OpenCV and dlib weâ€˜ll implement our drowsiness detector.
